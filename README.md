# Attendance_Face_Detection-
This project aims to develop an automated Attendance System using Face Detection with OpenCV and deep learning. The system captures real-time video from a webcam, detects faces, and verifies them against a stored database of registered users. Once a face is recognized, attendance is automatically recorded with a timestamp.
