# Overview
This project aims to develop an automated Attendance System using Face Detection with OpenCV and deep learning. The system captures real-time video from a webcam, detects faces, and verifies them against a stored database of registered users. Once a face is recognized, attendance is automatically recorded with a timestamp.
# Key Features:
- Real-time face detection using OpenCV.
-Face recognition to verify registered users.
- Automatic attendance marking with timestamps.
- Database integration to store attendance records.
- CSV/Excel export for attendance reports.
- User registration module to add new faces.
- Error handling to manage unrecognized faces or multiple users.
